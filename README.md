# PyExplorer
This is my first shot at making something in Thinker. It is crappy, trust me but it kinda works

Some buttons don't work since I am lazy.
To get started, type an adress into the long adress bar(the bigger one) and then click go. The files in that directory will appear below.

The button "File" at the top left corner of the screen has a drop down menu with a few options(Open new window, About, Close)

Like I said before, most of the stuff don't work since I am lazy. Might continue this project tho.
